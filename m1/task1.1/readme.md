The results of your work with Git

Whilst completing of the tasks I’ve created a few branches and filled them with the content. Branches “styles” and “images” were merged with the “develop” branch that was finally merged with the “main” branch. It was my first time working with GitHub and I’m not doing well at reading logs, so I couldn’t find the log from when I merged “styles” branch with “develop” branch, but I’ll work on my log-reading skills during the course. Git Bash and Visual Code Studio applications were used to work with the repository.

What is DevOps for me?

I used to think that DevOps is a highly-paid position in IT companies where you work only with cloud and hardware storages keeping the global network on its feet (preventing it from the fall). Now I’m aware why DevOps engineer is primarily engineer. As for me, it’s like being a handyman, knowing nuances of development&operating stages of production and merging with a team in order to give the client the most stable and up-to-date product on the market.
